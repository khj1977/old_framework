framework
=========

A MVC framework

The main aim of this web application framework is to combine philosophy of server side MVC framework and SmallTalk style MVC framework.

Old framework. Originally made at around 2012. 

Acknowledgement: 

Although the base of this framework was started as original project, most of code and idea has been made at the time working at Alfredcore, Tokyo, Japan. However, most of implementation of the code would different but share the same idea. Actually, no copy from that company and repository.

Also, some idea of framework around Dispatcher/Router is came from a framework made by old collegue when I was working at SpicySoft, Tokyo, Japan. However, it should be noted that only class structure is the same for Dispatcher/Router but the implementation is the different and other part of framework is differeent.

Some idea of this framework, which is incomplete in this repository, is described at the following CV:

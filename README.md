framework
=========

A MVC framework

The main aim of this web application framework is to combine philosophy of server side MVC framework and SmallTalk style MVC framework.

This code contains web application framework which is based on framework when I had been working for AlfredCore. The codes are similar but made from scratch. Since I haven't found code on github, I made this code from scratch. However, if it were found on github, I will fork and modify based on that code.
